SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Allows CIM sessions to be opened to Windows Server 2003 and above with 
    caching and super fast remote registry operations.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    CIM is the preferred method of interacting with WMI on a remote computer as
    it can reuse connections after they are made.

    However the built-in PowerShell command New-CimSession doesn't automatically
    cache connections or work with Windows Server 2003 remote hosts. This is 
    fixed by using this module's replacement function New-CimSessionDown.

    Furthermore, remote registry operations have always been problematic in 
    PowerShell. Either you resort to using .NET objects and handling COM 
    disposals, or you use a 3rd party module which just uses the same. This 
    module lets you read most common remote registry entries over a CIM 
    connection. This provides for output literally 2x-4x faster than other 
    methods which really adds up at scale.

    Functions are split between these types:

    * Common functions you should use
        New-CimSessionDown
        Get-CimRegKey
        Get-CimRegValues

    * Less common functions you should only use if required
        Get-CimRegEnumKey            
        Get-CimRegEnumValues         

        Get-CimRegBinaryValue        
        Get-CimRegDWORDValue         
        Get-CimRegExpandedStringValue
        Get-CimRegMultiStringValue   
        Get-CimRegQWORDValue         
        Get-CimRegStringValue   

    Remember, you should always specify -OperationTimeoutSec on any Get-Cim
    cmdlet. However any functions in this module default this for you to 30.

REQUIREMENTS
    PowerShell v3 only the computer using the function, not on the host.
    
EXAMPLE #1
    $cimSession = New-CimSessionDown C1N1
    Get-CimInstance -CimSession $cimSession -Class Win32_Service -OperationTimeoutSec 30

EXAMPLE #2
    Get-CimRegKey C1N1 "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing"

    $cimSession = New-CimSessionDown C1N1
    Get-CimRegEnumKey $cimSession "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing"
    Get-CimRegEnumValues $cimSession "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing"
    Get-CimRegStringValue $cimSession "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing" "RepairCategory"
    Get-CimRegDWORDValue $cimSession "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing" "EnableLog"
